**DiveOps** is me trying with a fancy name to attract both people interested in diving and DevOps topics (I can't be the only one interested in these things, right?).<br>
If you just want to use this as a template or something similar feel free to do that but please mention this blog.<br>
<br>


## Topics

- DevOps
- Kubernetes
- Homelabs
- Programming mainly with Java/Groovy and Python
- Diving and vacation experience
- Opinion pieces on BVB games and traveling to the very same games
- Random other stuff I am interested in like fantasy books / music or LotR
- etc...
<br>
<br>
I am always open to (constructive) criticism, opinion pieces or info related to these topics. You can get in touch with me via social media if you click the links on the bottom left.
